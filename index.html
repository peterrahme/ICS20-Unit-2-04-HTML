    <br>
    <p style="font-size:115%;">A Snakehead is a species of fish that migrated from Asia to the US. Snakeheads have many special features that help them survive and travel anywhere in the ocean which led them to become a invasive specie. They tend to eat fish, frogs and snakes. Many of them can grow up to 90 cm long and reproduce around 75,000 eggs a year.</p>
